that. Also change the returned URL for the POST call in the replay data

78d283b9b5c5222dd0ca2750db7b56a2a5545a39,"Updated setup.py to exclude tests (#1031)

# Problem #
The `.whl` available on PyPi for this repository contains its entire `tests` submodule. 

The total size of the `pygithub` module is less than `1mb` without tests and `>23mb` with. 

Previous discussions on this topic indicated the removal of tests would be accepted if someone created a pull request to do so: https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/672 

This is that pull request! 😄

# Solution/Implementation # 

- Moved ""tests"" to root of the repository ( outside the package ) 
    - Added `tests.` module path to the imports in `AllTests.py`
- Updated `setup.py`
    - Removed `package_data` from product
    - Removed ""tests"" from packages definition
    - Repointed `test_suite` to new location
- Updated `travis.yml`
    - Added conditional ( if not `py2.7` ) conversion of code to `py3`

9d2129c7b9ff4dc79aa9e0e0ee6f67678f11e546,"Example: Listen for New Events with PyGithub and Pyramid (#930)

## What does this change do?
Adds a small demo implementation of how one might use webhooks to listen for
new events in a given repository.

### Additions
#### doc/examples/Webhook.rst
Adds a new `.rst` file, `Webhook.rst`, which can be used for demonstrating the usage of Webhooks in PyGithub.

The example that I've added shows how to continually listen for events using Pyramid in conjunction with PyGithub.

## Motivation
This example is in the spirit of #874. [It was asked](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/874#issuecomment-429075695) that someone provide an example of how to listen to events from a repository.

## How has this been tested?
I've built the docs locally and made sure the HTML is generated as expected.

## Screenshots

ac8966cc8cb0b9acf3c9ea14162ae800474d4265,"Example to show How to get Commit Date (#927)

## What does this change do?
Adds a small example of how to get at the date a commit took place.

### Changes
#### doc/examples/Commit.rst
Adds a block of code that demonstrates how to get at a commit's date.

## Motivation
This example is in the spirit of #874.

When I began using PyGithub it was not readily apparent to me where the commit date was being abstracted to. Being unfamiliar with Git's API, it took some convincing for me to be satisfied that the `Commit.commit.author/committer.date` path would get me the commit date.

I would hope that this would save somebody a little bit of time in the future.

## How has this been tested?
I've built the docs locally and made sure the HTML is generated as expected.

faca4ce1c068aabe726173d3288ba950987491e0,"Add support for projects (#854)

Initial solution for [PyGithub support for projects](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/issues/606) (#606). Adds comprehensive project querying API.

Currently does not support for modifying projects, columns or cards. (I only need this interface for reporting purposes. Of course once I'm done others are more than welcome to add additional features!)

API that was integrated:
https://developer.github.com/v3/projects
https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/columns
https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/cards

Note that the Github project API is in preview mode - it requires a special header in order for requests to be processed, and the API is subject to change without notice.

## Summary
- new classes: Project, ProjectColumn, ProjectCard
- add Organization.get_projects method
- add Repository.get_projects method
- add MainClass.get_project method
- add test cases to exercise all new classes and methods and verify attributes are as expected; replay data is included, recorded (mostly) from my fork of PyGithub
- updated add_attribute script to:
  - use makeXXXAttribute API
  - be able to add to the end of the current set of properties
  - handle both Completable and NonCompletable class types correctly

The Branch protection API has been radically changed by GitHub, add new
methods to Branch reflecting it. Branch protection methods are now
called on the Branch object itself, rather than awkwardly hanging off
the Repository object and requiring branch names to be passed in.

This adds an over-arching methods to get, edit and remove protection
entirely, as well as fine-grained methods for getting, setting and
dropping certain aspects of branch protection, as well as three new
objects to encompass querying those aspects.

This also destroys Repository.protect_branch(), the endpoint has been
removed. The old-style protection attributes on Branch have also been
removed to force users onto the new API, since they are still sent, but
no longer populated.

Hi!

As part of my app, I use this lib, and then your test Framework to record my own upper level tests. Here's some patches I had to make that I humbly think could interest you:

- As stated by @kyogi14 in [this comment](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/664#issuecomment-389964369), since you use `requests` recording is broken. This fixes that.
- Fix some Python 3 troubles while recording
- Add a `replayDataFolder` gloval class variable, to override the default place to put the recording. Otherwise, if a third party app (like mine :)) has a dependency on PyGithub and wants to use the Framework, recordings are saved in `site-packages/github/tests/ReplayData` instead of my own place.

Hope this helps, please let me know if I can improve the PR.

5e8c683261828e8ca21a094b9ab160257200ff11,"Update the RepositoryKey class (#530)

# The problems I attempt to solve

- `RepositoryKey.created_at` is available on the Github API, but not in
PyGithub
- `RepositoryKey.edit()` is not supported anymore by the Github API,
see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/keys/#edit-a-deploy-key

# How I went about solving the problem

I added myself a new deploy key to one of my repositories, and recorded
the existing tests using my account.
I could not keep the existing test data as the specified key does not
exist anymore, I added a comment for the next contributor to help him
figure out how to record new tests.",lra,03/21/2018 07:09:31 AM,https://api.github.com/repos/PyGithub/PyGithub/commits/5e8c683261828e8ca21a094b9ab160257200ff11,1168827,163
